# CodeBible PowerShell Module

## Introduction

This module is intended to make it easier to run some of the scripts found in the [CodeBible Repository](https://github.com/HersheyTaichou/CodeBible). It also contains a few other modules that are useful in various situations.

Remember, just because these worked for me does not mean they will work for you. ALWAYS read and make sure you understand a script before you run it. 

## Getting Started

Each directory contains a module for a specific task or area and can be imported into PowerShell directly.

The commands do have help text, to remind you of what they can do and the options they have

I also welcome any pull requests with improvements or additions to my scripts.

And as always, Thank you!
